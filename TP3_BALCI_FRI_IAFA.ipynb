        "Ainsi, on peut conclure que **Coordinate Ascent (CA)** et **Random Forest (RF)** ont permis une amélioration statistiquement significative de **NDCG@10** par rapport à **TFIDF**, tandis que **LambdaMART (LMart)** a montré une amélioration, mais celle-ci n'est pas statistiquement significative."
